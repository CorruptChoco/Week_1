## Overview of Project
The purpose of this Analysis was to provide Louise useful information in a understandable format. To that end I created
2 charts that will be very useful to Louise's goal of creating a successful kickstarter to fund a theater production.

##Analysis Breakdown
#First Chart
The first chart below was created to show the outcomes of theater kickstarters given the month of the year. It was created
by using a pivot table to arange data such that the sum of outcomes is broken into groups in the columns. Those groups are 
then categoriesed into rows based on the month of the year. I then used this broken down data to create a line chart to
better visualize the data. From this line chart we can see that for Louise the she is likely to get the best outcome
for her kickstarter if her launch date is between May-Jul.
#Second Chart
The second chart below was created to show outcome of kickstarter campaigns in the plays subcategory based on a range of 
goal amounts. It data was curated with the COUNTIFS function within Excel.
